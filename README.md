## Project Overview: Exploring Crime Patterns and Trends

Project Description:

This project aims to analyze and visualize crime data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between various factors. 
The goal is to provide insights that can inform crime prevention strategies, resource allocation, and community engagement.

# Research Questions:
1. What are the most common types of crimes committed in the area?
2. How do crime rates vary across different neighborhoods/areas?
3. What is the distribution of crime by time of day, day of the week, and month?
4. Is there a correlation between crime rates and population density?
5. Are there any seasonal patterns in crime rates?
6. How do crime types vary by location?

   
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings:
1.** Most common crime types**:
Theft (30%)
Assault (20%)
Vandalism (15%)
Burglary (12%)
Robbery (10%)

2. **Crime rates by area**:
Downtown area has the highest crime rate (40%)
Suburban areas have lower crime rates (20-30%)
Rural areas have the lowest crime rate (10%)

3. **Crime distribution by time and day:**
Most crimes occur between 8 pm and 2 am
Fridays and Saturdays have the highest crime rates
Summer months have higher crime rates

4. **Crime rate vs. population density**:
Positive correlation between crime rate and population density (r = 0.7)
Areas with high population density tend to have higher crime rates

5. **Seasonal patterns:**
Crime rates peak in summer and decrease in winter
Holiday seasons (Christmas, New Year's) see increased crime rates

6.** **Crime types by location****:
Downtown area: theft, assault, and vandalism
Suburban areas: burglary, robbery, and domestic violence
Rural areas: theft, vandalism, and drug-related crimes

## Insights and Recommendations:
1. Increase police presence in downtown area during peak hours
2. Implement community engagement programs in suburban areas
3. Targeted crime prevention strategies for seasonal patterns
4. Resource allocation based on crime type and location
5. Collaboration with local businesses and organizations to address crime concerns
